- **Docker-ready Deployment**: Simple containerized setup for quick deployment in any environment.

## üîß Quick Start

### Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

Customize your MCP server settings by creating a `mcp_settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amap-maps": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@amap/amap-maps-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AMAP_MAPS_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless"
      ]
    },
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-fetch"
      ]
    },
    "slack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "your-bot-token",
        "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "your-team-id"
      }
    }
  },
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "$2b$10$Vt7krIvjNgyN67LXqly0uOcTpN0LI55cYRbcKC71pUDAP0nJ7RPa.",
      "isAdmin": true
    }
  ]
}
```

- The example includes several MCP servers with their configuration details. Add or remove servers based on your needs.
- The `users` section configures authentication. Default credentials: username `admin` with password `admin123`.
- Passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt. Generate a new password hash with:

  ```bash
  npx bcryptjs your-password
  ```

### Deployment Options

#### Using Docker (Recommended)

Launch MCPHub with default settings:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 samanhappy/mcphub
```

Or with custom settings:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./mcp_settings.json:/app/mcp_settings.json samanhappy/mcphub
```

#### Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and log in with your credentials (default: `admin`/`admin123`).

The dashboard provides:
- **Real-time Status Monitoring**: Live overview of all connected MCP servers
- **Server Management**: Enable/disable servers or modify their configuration
- **Group Management**: Organize servers into functional groups
- **User Administration**: Manage access permissions and user accounts

#### SSE Endpoint Integration

Connect your AI applications (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cherry Studio, etc.) to MCPHub via the SSE endpoint at:
```
http://localhost:3000/sse
```
